# WorkOS Provider

The WorkOS provider is used to interact with the resources supported by WorkOS. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Both the `api_key` and `host` options can be provided either directly or via the `WORKOS_API_KEY` and `WORKOS_API_HOST` environment variables respectively.
